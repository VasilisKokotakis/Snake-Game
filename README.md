## 🐍 Snake Game

````markdown

A simple **classic Snake Game** built with Python's `turtle` module.  
The game was created as a learning project to practice Python OOP concepts.  

---

## 🎮 How to Play
- Use the **Arrow Keys** to control the snake:
  - ⬆️ Up
  - ⬇️ Down
  - ⬅️ Left
  - ➡️ Right
- Eat the **blue food** to grow your snake.
- Each piece of food increases your score by **1**.
- The game ends if:
  - You hit the **wall**.
  - You hit your own **tail**.
